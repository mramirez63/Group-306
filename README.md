# Group-306
#Data Set: Lake in Muskogee off of Lake Michigan. Use the code and download some other stations and make the same analysis and relationship between those stations. Using Chesapeake Bay Region and NDBC
#Basic Meterological Data, use machine learning to predict and then also compare Rui's modeling data. Using 2017 Data
#Stations: Upper Bay- 8574728 Francis Scott Key Bridge, MD, Middle Bay- 44062 Gooses Reef, MD, Lower Bay- 8632837 Rappahannock Light, VA
#Notes: visualization [compare between sites in 2016 and 2018 time series], correlation between the Basic Meterological Data
#Steps: Obtain Data, Do a time series for each of 4 components, correlations between the components visualization, presentation
#Mireya: Dominant Wave Period, Average Wave Period, Correlation between componants to show why machine learning isnt needed
#Carter: Wave Direction, Wind Direction
#Rui: Sea Surface Temperature
#Kia: Air Temperature, Presentation Making
#Goal: Comparing the 3 sites in Cheseapeake Bay at different points in the bay during a dry year-low flow [2016] and a wet year-high flow [2018]
